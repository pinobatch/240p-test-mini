== About ==

The 240p Test Suite has
two goals:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for ability
   to handle 240p signals.
2. Turn a game console into
   a test signal generator
   to help in calibrating the
   black, white, and color
   levels of a display.

The Nintendo Entertainment
System (NES) can output 240
picture lines in a progressive
"double struck" mode. It does
not support interlaced video,
and its 52-color palette is
closer to HSV than RGB.
----
Press Start in any test
pattern to show help for
that pattern.

The test suite is also
available for several other
consoles. For more info, visit
http://junkerhq.net/240p

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture line-up
generation equipment) pattern
is used to adjust the TV's
"brightness" or black level.

The inner bars are a signal
level slightly lower than
standard black, which causes
some TVs to distort or even
lose sync. The outer bars
are the darkest mix of
colors the NES can show.

You should adjust brightness
until the outer bars are
clearly visible and inner
bars are not.
----
↓: Darken the entire screen
  by 25% with emphasis filter
A: Switch outer bars
  between gray and color
Select: Open PLUGE Contrast

The emphasis filter and gray
outer bars may misbehave on
NES consoles modded with
a 2C03 or 2C05 RGB PPU
taken from a Vs. System or
PlayChoice 10 arcade board.
----
The PLUGE Contrast
sub-test fills the screen
with a pattern based on the
SHARK (U+1F988) emoji.
Use it with various palettes
to check contrast and
brightness.

A: Switch palette among normal,
  dark, or light colors
Select: Return to PLUGE

== Gradient color bars ==

This pattern allows you to
calibrate the red, green, and
blue colors on your TV.

Use the TV's "contrast"
control to adjust the white
level such that four levels
each of red, green, and blue
and three levels of white
are visible, and the lightest
level of each color is
distinct from white.

A: Hide or show 16px grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

This approximation of SMPTE
EG 1-1990 can be used to
calibrate for approximate
color levels.

A: Toggle bars' brightness
Select: Toggle 1 kHz tone

With some TVs, you can turn
on blue-only mode to confirm
color balance. But because
the NES's composite encoder
does not attempt to produce
accurate RGB hues, these
colors will not be pure.

The mini-PLUGE at bottom
right causes some TVs
to distort or lose sync.

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows color
bars on a gray background.
Ideally, it would be used
with color filters to adjust
color balance. But as with
SMPTE bars, the NES PPU's
non-RGB model breaks the
blue filter trick.

A: Toggle bars' brightness
Select: Toggle 1 kHz tone

== Color bleed ==

This pattern helps diagnose
color bleed caused by
incorrect color resampling.

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern every frame
A: Switch among horizontal,
  vertical, and checkerboard
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter

Concept by Konsolkongen

== Grid ==

This pattern uses the
screen's full resolution.
Use it to verify that the
entire picture is visible,
including the red border,
with no distortion.

A: Change between 256x224
   and 256x240 pixel grids
Select: Change between
   black and gray background

Many games designed for
NTSC display may show
artifacts outside the
256x224 pixel area.

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows five
circles at the pixel aspect
ratio of the NES PPU. NTSC
is 8:7; PAL is close to 11:8.

Use it to verify the
horizontal to vertical
size ratio setting of your
display or scaler or to
verify the lack of barrel
distortion of a CRT.

The diameter of each circle
should be the same in all
directions, and the diameter
of all four small circles
should be the same.

A: Hide or show a
   square grid

== Gray ramp ==

This gray ramp should not
have a red, green, or blue
tint to it.

Some cheaper LCDs can have
different gamma curves for
the different components.

== Solid color screen ==

Some displays and scalers
have problems with sudden
changes between solid black
and solid white or bright
colors.  Other displays may
have dead or damaged pixels.
Some cables produce audio
buzzing while a white
screen is displayed.

←→: Change among solid
  white, black, red, green,
  and blue screens
A on black screen: Switch
  between black and below 
  black (some TVs lose sync)
A on white screen: Enter or
  leave custom color mode
↑↓: Change custom brightness
←→: Change custom hue

== IRE ==

This test shows a rectangle
centered on the screen and
displays its brightness as a
percentage of standard white.

Some TVs lose sync when
brightness becomes negative.
A good TV won't.

←→: Change brightness
A: Toggle emphasis

Percentage values measured

== Sharpness ==

Set the sharpness of your
TV to a value that shows
clean black and gray
transitions without white
ghost lines on the side.

Modern TVs' "sharpness"
control performs edge
enhancement, which is
designed for live action
SDTV or VHS sources.
Most TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. A few have
middle as no change,
high as enhancement,
and low as blurring.

A: Toggle brick wall

== Chroma crosstalk ==

This pattern shows colored
stripes arranged to exploit
crosstalk between the luma
and chroma of the composite
video output.

The 2C02 PPU's output stage
takes shortcuts to save cost.
Because it doesn't filter
chroma before adding it to
luma, diagonal stripes and
checkerboard patterns often
produce crosstalk artifacts.

On an NTSC NES, the word
"Pass" appears with flicker.
On an NES modified to output
RGB, the stripes won't spell
anything.

== CPU clock speed ==

Kevin Horton's Hi-Def NES
mod includes a feature to
overclock the NES CPU to
reduce slowdown in games.
This test measures the CPU's
clock rate using the length
of a scanline as a time base.

Though the NES has no
real-time clock, a program
can measure the clock rate
relative to the PPU's roughly
15.7 kHz horizontal retrace.
This frequency cannot be
changed without causing
the display to lose color
or even lose sync.
----
Then it uses NMI and sprite
0 timing to measure cycles
per frame and per scanline.
It guesses the hsync rate
based on whether the PPU
is making 262 or 312 lines:

  NTSC: 15745.80 Hz
  PAL:   15602.18 Hz

From this, it calculates
CPU clock speed.
It repeats this calculation
every few frames, so if you
change the CPU's speed
while the test runs, the
displayed value will update.

== Overscan ==

With this pattern you can
discover how much of the
picture edge your TV hides.

Historically, CRT TVs
have been calibrated to
"overscan", or draw the
picture slightly past the
visible area, in case aging
capacitors cause the picture
to shrink over time. This
continues into the modern
era, as a lot of productions
have unwanted information
in this overscan area.

↑↓←→: Choose an edge
Hold A + ↑↓←→:
  Move that edge
----
Move each edge inward until
you see the white border,
then go back one pixel. Or
leave one border pixel visible
and subtract 1. The result
is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

The NES picture is 256x240
pixels. The nominal 4:3 frame
on NTSC is 280x240, including
12 pixels of border at left
and right. The displayed
amounts do not include this
side border.

PAL NES border is always
black. It covers 2 pixels
of the left and right sides
and 1 on the top.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other frame,
flickering at 30 or 25 Hz.
Many games use such a
flicker effect to show
transparency, such as
during mercy invincibility.

Some deinterlacers display
drop shadows correctly but
still interpret 240p as 480i.
The striped sprite should
make attempted deinterlacing
easy to spot.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame
  or rotate stripes
A+↑: Change shadow type
  (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change sprite shape

These shouldn't happen:
- Background loses detail
- Shadow disappears
- Thin horizontal stripes
  in flicker pattern

== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps you
measure a TV's lag, detect
dropped frames, or just
count how long your spouse
has been on the phone.

A: Start/stop
Select when stopped: Reset
Select when running: Lap
↑: Change ruler at left
   (show, hide, or show
   during even frames)
↓: Toggle inactive circles

The clock face below helps
determine the frame even
when the numbers above are
blurry.
----
Lag measurement

To measure lag, get a
camera and connect two
displays at once. One is
being tested, and the other
(the reference) should be a
CRT SDTV or a display with
known lag. For example,
connect a CRT to the RF out
of a front-loading NES and
your scaler to the AV out.

Then photograph both
screens at once. The picture
will show the difference in
image processing latency
between them. Some consumer
LCD TVs exceed five frames.
----
Lag measurement

The ruler helps count
scanlines of lag. Use a
short exposure on your
camera and divide lines by
15.7 to get milliseconds.

When Kevin Horton's Hi-Def
NES mod is enabled, the
video out works differently:
white for sprites and black
for background. The frame
counter and ruler are drawn
as sprites to remain visible.
----
Dropped frames

A scaler with a frame buffer
may drop frames because the
frame rate of the NTSC NES
and Super NES (60.10 Hz) is
faster than standard (59.94
Hz).

At 59.94 Hz, it drops one
frame in 345: one per 5.75
seconds or two per 11.5.
At 60.00 Hz, it drops one
frame in 607: one per 10.12
seconds or two per 20.24.

Hi-Def NES compensates for
this by slowing down the
CPU and PPU.

== Manual lag test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag by
showing a changing pattern
on the screen, optionally
with audio.

Press A when the moving
and still reticles align
to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection and whether it
was early or late. After ten
non-early presses, their
average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change setting's value

Settings include the direction
of the moving reticle
(horizontal, vertical, or both),
whether to randomize timing
of movement, and whether to
beep when A is pressed or
beep and flash when the
reticles align.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This shows a scrolling
background with several
parallax strips. It can be
used to notice any drops
in frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Stop or start

== Vertical scroll test ==

This shows a scrolling
background. It can be
used to measure cadence
detection in a deinterlacer.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Stop or start

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid is scrolled vertically
or horizontally. This can be
used to test linearity and
how well the display copes
with scrolling and frame rate.
Some scalers may produce a
still image at maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Stop or start
A + ↑↓←→: Change direction

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a pattern of
lines, each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern every frame
A: Switch among horizontal,
  vertical, and checkerboard
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter

While you hold Up, the lines
should flicker. If holding
Up makes a still image, your
scaler is treating the signal
as interlaced and either
discarding every other frame
or weaving them incorrectly.

== Backlight zone test ==

This test displays a small
moving square, letting you
check how a display works
with small bright areas.
Some LED-lit LCDs dim
darker areas to make black
areas darker, which causes
problems with scenes such
as starfields and credits.

↑↓←→: Move the square
Select: Change its size among
  1, 2, 4, or 8 pixels on a side
A: Hide or show the square

== Sound test: Frequency ==

250 Hz
125 Hz
62 Hz

Buzz noise
Crowd (PCM)

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure
that the audio output works
and that audio and video are
synchronized.

A: Play a sound and
  flash the screen

The NES CPU has two audio
output pins. It produces two
pulse (square) waves on
one and triangle, noise, and
sample playback on the other.

Most options in the menu use
the triangle wave because it
is the purest built-in tone,
though it has a prominent
overtone 5 octaves up.
----
The CPU generates noise with
a polynomial counter that
can operate in two modes:
hiss (32767 steps)
or buzz (93 steps).
On the earliest revisions
of the CPU, hiss and buzz
sound the same.

Some people modify NES
consoles to make fake stereo,
with pulse on the left and
everything else on the right.
----
The PCM (sampled sound)
output is tested with a
bytebeat composition,
defined by evaluating a
bitwise formula 8000 times
a second and using it as
sample values.

// "Crowd" by Kragen

main(t) { for (;;t++) putchar(
  ((t<<1)^
   ((t<<1)+(t>>7)&t>>12))
  | t>>(4-(1^7&(t>>19)))
  | t>>7
); }

== Audio sync test ==

This test flashes the whole
screen white for two frames
along with a 1 kHz test tone
when the dot hits the floor.

You can verify the sync
between audio and video
with recording equipment
or an oscilloscope.

A: Start/stop the test

== Zapper test ==

This tests whether a Zapper
light gun plugged into port
2 will work with your TV.

Arrows at the right side
show where it's pointed (red)
and how long the photodiode
remains activated (gray).
A red arrow significantly
below where the barrel is
pointed indicates scaler lag.

Point barrel up and down:
  Move arrows
----
The Zapper uses a 15.7 kHz
resonator to tell a CRT
SDTV's light from, say, a
light bulb. Thus it won't see
a high-definition CRT, whose
horizontal sync rate is far
higher, or an LCD that doesn't
flicker in the first place.

It is conjectured that the
Zapper will see a 31 kHz CRT
with every other line dark,
such as a line doubler that
draws "scanlines" between
picture lines and has delay
less than 5 lines (317 us).
