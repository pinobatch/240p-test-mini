160p Test Suite
===============

The [240p Test Suite] is a homebrew application for video game
consoles that helps evaluate compatibility of upscalers and other
video processors, either stand-alone or built into a TV, with retro
consoles' video.

This program is a port of Artemio Urbina's 240p Test Suite
to the Game Boy Advance.

Usage
-----
This is a multiboot program, one that runs entirely in RAM.  It can
be loaded onto a GBA through a flash card, a GBA Movie Player, a PC
with an MBV2 or Xboo multiboot cable, or the homebrew Game Boy
Interface software for GameCube.

In menus and help:

* Control Pad ⬅➡: Turn page
* Control Pad ⬆⬇: Move cursor
* A Button: Choose option
* B Button: Go to previous menu
* Start Button: Show help for menu

In an activity:

* Control Pad, A, Select: Control activity
* Start Button: Show help for activity
* B Button: Close activity

To show help for any test, press Start or read `src/helppages.txt`.
Gus, the character at left, was an esports instructor until game
publishers cracked down on the esports academies in June 2012 and
July 2013.  Then he became a home theater installer.

Because the controls match the Game Boy Color version, the L and R
(shoulder) buttons are not used.

Versions
--------
The Game Boy Advance system outputs progressive video with 160
lines of picture.  Its TFT panel has 32 levels per RGB channel
and a reputation for crushing black levels, for which its launch
titles failed to compensate.  Game Boy Advance SP and Nintendo DS
are backlit.

The Game Boy Player accessory for Nintendo GameCube outputs 480i
or 480p video.  It acts as a scaler to allow use of GBA software
with a television.

The GBA display works by absorbing light instead of emitting it.
Because of this "subtractive" nature, as well as the overall
darkness on GBA prior to SP, many tests allow inverting grays
with the Select Button.

To keep positive and negative voltages balanced, an LCD inverts each
pixel's polarity on alternate frames.  Game Boy displays alternate
the polarity by row.  Slight level differences between a pixel and
its inverted counterpart can look like interlace.
(See "[LCD monitor technology and tests]" by W. Andrew Steer.)

The Nintendo DS system outputs progressive video with 192
lines of picture.  Its TFT panel also has 32 levels per RGB channel,
with varying degrees of brightness in newer models.

NES and Game Boy ports are also available.

Artemio Urbina maintains the upstream suite on five platforms:

* Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), as cartridge and Sega CD
* TurboGrafx-16 (PC Engine), as HuCard, CD-ROM2, and Super CD-ROM2
* Super NES (Super Famicom), as cartridge
* Sega Dreamcast, as MIL-CD
* Nintendo GameCube and Wii, as GameCube disc and DOLs for SD loader

The name
--------
NTSC analog televisions were designed for interlaced video conforming
to CCIR [System M and System J], which specify an analog video
signal with 15.734 kHz by 59.94 Hz sync frequencies and 480 out of
525 lines.  Most video game consoles before the Dreamcast bent the
rules, producing progressive video with 240 out of 262 or 263 lines.
This was out of spec yet within TVs' tolerances.  This sort of signal
came to be called "240p" video.

Some handhelds drive their internal LCD with System M-like timings.
For example, the Game Gear's display has 144 active lines, which
are centered in the 240p output of EvilTim's [Game Gear RGB] mod.
The Nintendo DS likewise drives 192 out of 263 lines at 15.7 kHz
according to [timings in GBATEK].  The GBA, on the other hand, uses
an incompatibly slower 13.6 kHz horizontal sync.  Game Boy Player
has to use a frame buffer to convert the timing to 240p or 480i,
which adds lag.  This is why the GBA port is renamed.

Limits
------
* Alternate 240p/480i is omitted because Game Boy Player offers
  no control over the host system's interlace mode.  GBI users
  can use the native GameCube suite instead.
* The true IRE levels of the GameCube's output when running Game Boy
  Player have not yet been measured.

Building GBA
--------
Build requirements: GNU Coreutils and Make (use devkitPro MSYS on
Windows), devkitARM, libgba, Python 3, and Pillow.

Under Windows, open a devkitPro MSYS and type `make`.  Under Linux
or macOS, once you have installed `gba-dev` using pacman, type these:

    source /etc/profile.d/devkit-env.sh
    make

Building NDS
--------
The NDS build is based on BlocksDS.

Build requirements: GNU Coreutils and Make (use devkitPro MSYS on
Windows), BlocksDS, Python 3, and Pillow.

Running make should suffice, provided the BLOCKSDS
environment variable is properly set.
