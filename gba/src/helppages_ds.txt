== About ==

The 240p Test Suite
has two goals:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for
   ability to handle retro
   console video signals.
2. Turn a game console into
   a test signal generator
   to help in calibrating the
   black, white, and color
   levels and geometry of
   a display.
----
The Nintendo DS
system outputs 192 lines of
progressive video per screen.
All models compatible with
this software are.

Development hardware can
either output 480p or
480i, depending on the
settings.
----
Press Start in any test
to show relevant help.

The test suite is also
available for several
other consoles.

== Grid ==

This grid uses the screen's
full 256x192 pixel resolution.
Use it to verify that the
entire picture is visible,
including the red border,
with no distortion.

Select: Invert grays

== Monoscope ==

Contains elements to
calibrate multiple aspects
of a CRT. Read your TV's
service manual to learn how.

Convergence:
Use the center crosshair
to check static (center
of screen) convergence.
Use the patterns at the
sides to check dynamic
(edge) convergence.

↑↓: Change brightness
----
Adjust convergence at low
brightness. An overly bright
pattern causes bloom that
masks convergence issues.

Corners:
After setting center and
edge convergence, use
magnets to adjust corner
purity and geometry.
----
Size and aspect ratio:
After setting horizontal
size, use a tape measure to
adjust vertical size until
the red squares are square.

Linearity:
The squares in each corner
should get you started.
Confirm your adjustment
using the scroll tests.

Pattern by khmr33; adapted
to NDS by Lorenzoone

== Convergence ==

Use these patterns to adjust
a CRT's color convergence.

Fine grid
↑↓: Change grid pattern
  (lines, dots, crosses)
Select: Invert grays
A: Go to colors

Color transition boundaries
↑↓: Hide or show
  black borders
A: Go to fine grid

== Gray ramp ==

Use this pattern to
check color balance.
This gray ramp should
not have a colored tint.

Cheap color LCDs may
have different gamma
curves per component.

== Solid color screen ==

Some displays and scalers
have problems with sudden
changes between deep black
and white. Others may have
stuck or damaged pixels.

←→: Change color among
  white, black, red,
  green, or blue
A on white: Hide or show
  RGB input
↑↓←→: Change RGB value
----
Poor high-voltage regulation
in a CRT causes image size
to depend on brightness.

== HEALTH WARNING ==

This pattern flashes.
Do not use it if you
have a seizure disorder.

Prolonged use may also cause
temporary screen issues
to DSi XL and 3DS consoles
with IPS screens.
TN screens are safe.

A: Continue anyway
B: Cancel

== Motion blur ==

This tests how quickly an
LCD reacts to changes in
gray level by toggling a
square between two shades.
Use it with a high-speed
camcorder, or set the
shades the same to
check gray levels.

↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value
A: Start or stop the test
X/R: 60 hz/80 hz
----
Regular DS consoles
should show an image
which very slightly
flickers in 60 hz mode.
When using 80 hz mode,
the flicker should
disappear almost entirely.

Due to the way DS software
is rendered on 3DS consoles,
80 hz mode doesn't work on
them.
----
DSi XL and 3DS consoles
with IPS screens have may
experience temporary
ghosting effects when using
this pattern for a prolonged
period of time.
The issue should disappear
by using the console with
regular software.

On such consoles, when
this pattern is viewed
from an angle, a white
flickering image should
appear on IPS screens.
On TN screens, a gray one
should show instead.

== Sharpness ==

Set the sharpness of your
TV to a value that shows
clean black and gray
transitions without white
ghost lines on the side.

Select: Invert grays
A: Toggle brick wall
----
Modern TVs' "sharpness"
control performs edge
enhancement, intended
for live action SDTV or
VHS sources.
Most TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. A few have
middle as no change,
high as enhancement,
and low as blurring.

== Overscan ==

Use this pattern to check
how much of the picture
edge your NDS' lenses hide.

The LCD is recessed
in the chassis. This can
cast shadows on the
screen's edges depending
on the lighting angle.

↑↓←→: Choose an edge
A + ↑↓←→: Move edge
Select: Invert grays
----
Move each edge inward
until you see the border,
then go back one pixel. Or
leave one border pixel visible
and subtract 1. The result
is the amount of overscan
in pixels in each direction.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a shadow
sprite on every other
frame, flickering at 30 Hz.
Many games use such flicker
to show transparency.

Some deinterlacers display
drop shadows correctly but
still interpret 240p as 480i.
The striped sprite should
make this easy to spot.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame
   or rotate stripes
A+↑: Change shadow type
   (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change sprite shape
  (Star of Lakshmi or
  Hepsie the fairy godmother)

These shouldn't happen:
- Background loses detail
- Shadow disappears
----
DSi XL and 3DS consoles
with IPS screens have may
experience temporary
ghosting effects when using
this pattern for a prolonged
period of time.
The issue should disappear
by using the console with
regular software.

While in flicker mode:
Nintendo DS screens should
show horizontal stripes.
TN screens will show a
pixelated texture.
IPS screens will show no
texture.

== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps
you measure a TV's lag,
detect dropped frames,
time a workout, etc.

A: Start or stop
Select stopped: Reset
Select running: Lap
↑: Change ruler at left
   (show, hide, or blink)
↓: Hide or show
   inactive circles
----
The clock face below helps
determine the frame even
when the numbers above are
blurry.

The stopwatch assumes
60 Hz display, while the NDS
actually runs at 59.83 Hz.
This means it runs slightly
slow (1 part in 345).
----
To measure lag, get a
camera and connect two
displays to one NDS'
screen's output.
One is being tested, and
the other (the reference)
should be a CRT SDTV or
a display with known lag.
For example, connect
a CRT and your scaler
using a cable with both
composite and S-Video out.
----
Then photograph both
screens at once.
The picture will show
the latency difference
between them. Some LCD
TVs exceed five frames.

The ruler helps count
scanlines of lag. Use a
short exposure on your
camera and divide lines by
15.7 to get milliseconds.
To avoid errors caused
by rolling shutter, put
the TVs side by side.

== Timing and reflex test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag
by showing a changing
pattern on the screen,
optionally with audio.

Press A when the moving
and still reticles align
to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection. After ten
non-early presses,
their average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value

Settings include the direction
of the moving reticle, whether
to randomize timing of
movement, and whether to
beep when A is pressed
or beep and flash when
the reticles align.

== Hill zone scroll test ==

This shows a scrolling
background with several
parallax strips. It can
be used to notice any
drops in frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop
X/R: 60 hz/80 hz
Y/L: FPS - 100%/50%/BFI
----
Due to the way DS software
is rendered on 3DS consoles,
80 hz mode doesn't work on
them.

By switching the framerate,
one may observe how BFI can
significantly reduce
motion blur, at the expense
of brightness.
60 hz is not enough for BFI,
so the screen should flicker.
BFI in 80 hz mode should
result in almost no
flicker, with reduced
motion blur.
----
DSi XL and 3DS consoles
with IPS screens have may
experience temporary
ghosting effects when using
BFI for a prolonged
period of time.
The issue should disappear
by using the console with
regular software.

== Vertical scroll test ==

This test shows a
scrolling background.
Use it to measure
cadence detection in a
deinterlacer or row
inversion artifacts
in a handheld LCD.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop
X/R: 60 hz/80 hz
Y/L: FPS - 100%/50%/BFI

== Grid scroll test ==

A grid scrolls vertically or
horizontally. Use it to test
linearity and how well the
display copes with scrolling
and frame rate. Some scalers
may produce a still image
at maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Start or stop
A + ↑↓←→: Change direction
Select: Invert grays

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a pattern of
lines, each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the pattern
  by one pixel
Hold ↑↓←→: Move every frame
A: Rotate stripes
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter
----
While you hold Up, the lines
should flicker. If holding
Up makes a still image, your
scaler is treating the signal
as interlaced and either
dropping or weaving frames.
A solid gray image indicates
slow LCD response time.

== Backlight zones ==

This test displays a small
moving square, letting
you check how a display
handles small bright areas.
Some LED-lit LCDs dim
dark areas to make blacks
deeper, which causes
problems with scenes such
as starfields and credits.
Some CRTs' phosphors cause
bright moving objects to
leave a trail.
----
↑↓←→: Move the square
A: Hide or show the square
A+↑↓: Change width
  (1, 2, 4, or 8 pixels)
A+←→: Change speed
  low: 1 pixel per frame
  high: 1 width per frame
Select: Invert grays

To measure image decay time,
use a high-speed camera to
record the screen while
closing this help page or
moving in high speed.

== Sound test: Frequency ==

8000 Hz
4000 Hz
2000 Hz
1000 Hz
500 Hz
250 Hz
125 Hz
62 Hz
1000 Hz left
1000 Hz right
1000 Hz (pulse)
1000 Hz (surround)
Hiss noise
Buzz noise

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure
that the audio output
works and that audio and
video are synchronized.

A: Play a sound and
  flash the screen

All NDS systems output
stereo audio. Each voice can
be panned center,
left or right.
All audio channels
can execute PCM8, PCM16
or IMA-ADPCM sounds.
Specific ones may use PSG
and Noise to generate audio.
----
Most choices use PCM8
with an approximate sine
wave. It has a prominent
overtone 5 octaves up.

Hiss is generated by Noise.
Buzz is generated by PSG.
----
Surround is played 180
degrees out of phase and
should be silent on the
mono internal speaker.
Matrix surround decoders
such as Dolby Pro Logic
send it to the rear.

== Audio sync ==

This test flashes the
screen for two frames
and plays a tone when
the dot hits the floor.

You can verify sync
between audio and video
with recording equipment
or an oscilloscope.

A: Start or stop the test

== Lame boy ==

This test served as a
placeholder in early versions
of the Suite for tests not yet
ported to Game Boy Advance.
It's still cute.

←→: Move

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture line-up
generation equipment) pattern
is used to adjust the TV's
"brightness" or black level.
For most sources, lower the
brightness until the outer
bar is not visible, and slowly
raise it until it shows.

A: Toggle setup
  (NTSC or NTSC-J/PAL)
Select: Open PLUGE Contrast
----
NDS' 32 shades should
correspond to signal level
steps of about 3.2 IRE.
(This needs further testing.)
This would put shade 0 at
NTSC-J black (0 IRE) and
shade 2 near NTSC's 7.5 IRE
setup. PAL TV and US game
consoles also use 0 IRE.

NTSC: shades 3 and 0
  on background 2
NTSC-J: shades 1 and 0.5
  on background 0
----
The PLUGE Contrast
pattern fills the screen
with a shark pictogram.
Use it with various
palettes to check
contrast and brightness.

A: Switch palette among color,
  dark, darker, light, or lighter
Select: Return to PLUGE

== Gradient color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate colors on a TV.
Increase the contrast
(white level) until C and
E in the white ramp look
the same, then decrease
it slowly until you can
tell them apart.

A: Hide or show grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate for NTSC levels
regarding contrast,
brightness, and colors.
Use some displays'
blue-only mode to
confirm color balance.

Based on SMPTE EG 1-1990

↑: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
A: Toggle setup
  (NTSC or NTSC-J/PAL)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows color
bars on a gray background.
Use it with color filters
to adjust color balance.

Based on Digital Video
Essentials: HD Basics

↑: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
A: Toggle setup
  (NTSC or NTSC-J/PAL)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bleed ==

Use this pattern to
diagnose color bleed
caused by incorrect
color resampling.
