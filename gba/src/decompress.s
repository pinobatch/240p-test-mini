@ALIGNMENT_FIX has an impact of around 0.25% on performance, but it prevents
@alignment warnings (which wouldn't affect real hardware).
#define ALIGNMENT_FIX

@OVERRUN_PROTECTION has an impact of around 0.9% on performance, but it
@prevents overrunning the buffer by up to 2 extra bytes if the compressed data
@has issues. Apparently, the regular BIOS functions lack any kind of overrun
@protection. So instead of potentially writing 2 extra bytes, they could
@write way more...
#define OVERRUN_PROTECTION

@PREVENT_OOB_READS has an impact of around 2% on performance. It prevents
@the LZ77 window from going to an address before the initial destination one.
@Such LZ77 data is badly formed, and this shouldn't be enabled at all
@unless you don't trust the data coming in...
