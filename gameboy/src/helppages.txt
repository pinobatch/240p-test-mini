== About ==

The 240p Test Suite
has two goals:

1. Evaluate TV sets and
   video processors for
   ability to handle retro
   console video signals.
2. Provide a test signal
   generator to help in
   calibrating levels and
   geometry of a display.
----
The Game Boy outputs
144 lines of progressive
video. The original
Game Boy and Game Boy
Pocket have a passive
matrix STN LCD with
four shades of gray.
The Super Game Boy
accessory maps these
shades to colors.
Game Boy Color has
a TFT LCD with 32
levels per RGB channel.
----
Press Start in any test
to show relevant help.

The test suite is also
available for several
other consoles.

== Grid ==

This grid uses the
screen's full resolution.
Use it to verify that the
entire picture is visible,
including the border,
with no distortion.

Select: Invert grays

== Linearity ==

This pattern shows
five circles at the
square pixel aspect ratio
of the Game Boy screen.
Use it to verify the
horizontal to vertical
size ratio setting of
a display or scaler or
to measure distortion
on a CRT.

A: Hide or show grid
Select: Invert grays
----
On handhelds and
Game Boy Player, the
circles should have the
same diameter in all
directions. Super Game
Boy stretches them
horizontally by 14%
on NTSC or 38% on PAL.

== Convergence ==

Use these to adjust a
CRT's color convergence.

Fine grid
↑↓: Change grid pattern
  (lines, dots, crosses)
Select: Invert grays
A: Go to colors

Color transition
boundaries (SGB/GBC)
↑↓: Hide or show
  black borders
A: Go to fine grid

== Gray ramp ==

Use this pattern to
check color balance.
This gray ramp should
not have a colored tint.
On Game Boy or Game Boy
Pocket, four shades
should be distinct.

Cheap color LCDs may
have different gamma
curves per component.

== Solid screen ==

Some displays and
scalers have problems
with sudden changes
between deep black and
white. Others may have
stuck or damaged pixels.

←→: Change gray level
  or color
A on white: Hide or show
  RGB input (SGB/GBC)
↑↓←→: Change RGB value
----
Poor high-voltage
regulation in a CRT
causes image size to
depend on brightness.
This changes border
width on Super Game Boy
or Game Boy Player.

== HEALTH WARNING ==

This pattern flashes.
Do not use it if you
have a seizure disorder.

A: View pattern
B: Cancel

== Motion blur ==

This tests how quickly
an LCD reacts to
changes in gray level
by toggling a square
between two shades.
Use it with a high-speed
camcorder, or set the
shades the same to
check gray levels.

↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value
A: Start or stop
----
The STN LCD in the
original Game Boy and
Game Boy Pocket has a
slow response, which
blurs fast motion.
Game Boy Color's
TFT greatly improves
response time.
All GB LCDs use row
inversion that can look
like interlace, drawing
even or odd lines darker
in alternate frames.
----
STN smearing:

Passive matrix LCDs lack
a transistor to block
crosstalk from other
scanlines. Thus the
image on each line leaks
a bit into other lines.
Dark areas end up with
vertical stripes above
and below them.

== Sharpness ==

Set the sharpness of
your TV to a value that
shows clean black and
gray transitions without
white lines on the side.

Select: Invert grays
A: Toggle brick wall
----
Modern TVs' "sharpness"
control performs edge
enhancement intended
for live action sources.
Most TVs have zero as
no change and high as
enhancement. A few have
middle as no change,
high as enhancement,
and low as blurring.

== Overscan ==

Use this pattern to
check how much of
the picture edge your
Game Boy's lens hides.

The LCD is recessed
in the chassis. This can
cast shadows on the
screen's edges depending
on the lighting angle.

↑↓←→: Choose an edge
A + ↑↓←→: Move edge
Select: Invert grays
----
Move each edge inward
until you see the border,
then go back one pixel.
Or leave one border pixel
visible and subtract 1.
The result is the amount
of overscan in pixels in
each direction.

== Shadow sprite ==

This test draws a
shadow sprite on every
other frame, flickering
at 30 Hz.  Many games
use such flicker to
show transparency.

Some deinterlacers show
drop shadows OK but
still interpret 240p as
480i. The striped sprite
should make this easy
to spot.
----
↑↓←→: Move sprite
A: Skip flicker frame
  or rotate stripes
A+↑: Change shadow type
  (flicker or stripes)
A+←→: Change background
Select: Change shape

These shouldn't happen:
- Background loses detail
- Shadow disappears
- Thin horizontal stripes
  in flicker mode
----
Row inversion to balance
charge on an LCD may
resemble interlace.

Got burn-in?

A scratchy power switch
on a monochrome system
can cause horizontal
rows of dots to fade.
goombobros reported that
turning the contrast dial
to black and changing
background (A+→) for
a couple minutes can
revive faint lines.
== Stopwatch ==

This stopwatch helps
you measure a TV's lag,
detect dropped frames,
time a workout, etc.

A: Start or stop
Select stopped: Reset
Select running: Lap
↑: Change ruler at left
   (show, hide, or blink)
↓: Hide or show
   inactive circles
----
The clock face below
helps determine the
frame even when the
numbers above are
blurry.

Because the stopwatch
assumes 60 Hz, it runs
a bit slow on a handheld
(1 part in 219) or faster
on Super Game Boy
(1 part in 51).
----
To measure lag, get a
camera and connect two
TVs to one Super NES.
One is being tested, and
the other (the reference)
should be a CRT SDTV or
a display with known lag.
For example, connect
a CRT to RF out and
your scaler to AV out.
----
Then photograph both
screens at once.
The picture will show
the latency difference
between them. Some LCD
TVs exceed five frames.

The ruler helps count
scanlines of lag. Use a
short exposure on your
camera and divide lines by
15.7 to get milliseconds.
----
Tests on SGB should be
repeated several times
because SGB drops a lot
of frames. It runs the GB
at 61.18 Hz but itself
outputs video at 60.10
Hz, dropping one frame
in 57. A scaler in turn
drops one frame in 345
or 607 depending on
59.94 or 60.00 Hz output.

== Timing and reflex test ==

This helps quantify a
display's processing lag
by showing a changing
pattern on the screen,
optionally with audio.

Press A when the moving
and still reticles align
to display the offset in
frames from the actual
intersection. After ten
non-early presses,
their average is shown.
----
↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value

Settings include the
direction of the moving
reticle, whether to
randomize timing of
movement, and whether to
beep when A is pressed
or beep and flash when
the reticles align.

== Hill zone scroll ==

This shows a scrolling
background with several
parallax strips. Use it
to notice any drops in
frame rate.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop

== Vertical scroll ==

This test draws a
scrolling background.
Use it to measure
cadence detection in a
deinterlacer or row
inversion artifacts
in a handheld LCD.

↑↓: Change speed
←→: Change direction
A: Start or stop

== Grid scroll ==

A grid scrolls vertically
or horizontally. Use it
to test linearity and
how well the display
copes with scrolling and
frame rate. Some scalers
produce a still image at
maximum speed.

↑↓: Change speed
A: Start or stop
A + ↑↓←→:
  Change direction
Select: Invert grays

== Full screen stripes ==

You should see a
pattern of lines,
each one pixel wide.

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold: Move every frame
A: Rotate stripes
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter
----
While you hold Up, the
lines should flicker.
If holding Up makes a
still image, your scaler
is treating the signal as
interlaced and dropping
or weaving frames.
A solid gray image
indicates slow LCD
response.

== Backlight zones ==

This test draws a
small moving square,
letting you check how
a display handles
small bright areas.
Some LED-lit LCDs dim
dark areas to make
blacks deeper, which
causes problems with
scenes such as
starfields and credits.
Some CRTs' phosphors
cause bright moving
objects to leave a trail.
----
↑↓←→: Move the square
A: Hide or show square
A+↑↓: Change width
  (1, 2, 4, or 8 pixels)
A+←→: Change speed
  low: 1 pixel per frame
  high: 1 width per frame
Select: Invert grays
----
To measure image decay
time, use a high-speed
camera to record the
screen while closing
this help page or
moving at high speed.

== Sound test: Frequency ==

8000 Hz
4000 Hz
2000 Hz
1000 Hz
500 Hz
250 Hz
125 Hz
62 Hz
1000 Hz left

Hiss noise
Buzz noise

== Sound test ==

Use this test to ensure
that the audio output
works and that audio and
video are synchronized.

A: Play a sound and
  flash the screen

The Game Boy outputs
stereo audio. Each
voice (pulse 1, pulse 2,
wavetable, and noise)
can be panned left,
center, or right.
----
Most choices use the
wavetable with an
approximate sine wave.
It has a prominent
overtone 5 octaves up.

The CPU generates noise
with a polynomial counter
at period 32767 for hiss
or 127 for buzz.
----
Surround is played 180
degrees out of phase and
should be silent on the
mono internal speaker.
Matrix surround decoders
such as Dolby Pro Logic
send it to the rear.

== MDFourier ==

This plays a series of
tones to generate an
audio signature for the
MDFourier analysis tool.
junkerhq.net/MDFourier

Record the audio output
using a sound card
and compare it to
other systems using
the GB v1 profile.

A: Play tones   B: Stop
----
To skip to MDFourier,
hold Start at startup.

== Audio sync ==

This test flashes the
screen for two frames
and plays a tone when
the dot hits the floor.

You can verify sync
between audio and video
with recording equipment
or an oscilloscope.

A: Start or stop

== Lame boy ==

This served as a
placeholder in early
versions of the Suite for
tests not yet ported to
Game Boy. It's still cute.

←→: Move

PLUGE
Color bars on gray
Color bleed
Chroma crosstalk
SGB sound

== Color tests ==

These patterns measure
color balance on
Game Boy Color or
Super Game Boy.
They do not work on
original Game Boy or
Game Boy Pocket.

== PLUGE ==

The PLUGE (picture
line-up generation
equipment) pattern is
used to adjust the TV's
"brightness" or black
level. Adjust it until
the outer bar is barely
visible.

A: Toggle setup
  (NTSC or NTSC-J/PAL)
Select: Go to PLUGE
  Contrast
----
The 32 shades on
SGB and GBC should
correspond to signal level
steps of about 3.2 IRE.
(This needs further
testing.) This would put
shade 0 at NTSC-J black
(0 IRE) and shade 2 near
NTSC's 7.5 IRE setup.

NTSC: shades 3 and 0
  on background 2
NTSC-J: shades 1 and 0.5
  on background 0
----
The PLUGE Contrast
pattern fills the screen
with a shark pictogram.
Use it with various
palettes to check
contrast and brightness.

A: Switch palette among
  color, dark, darker,
  light, or lighter
Select: Go to PLUGE

== Gradient color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate colors on
a TV. Increase the
contrast until C and
E in the white ramp
look the same, then
decrease it slowly until
you can tell them apart.

A: Hide or show grid

== SMPTE color bars ==

Use this pattern to
calibrate for NTSC
levels regarding
contrast, brightness,
and colors. Use some
displays' blue-only mode
to confirm color balance.
Based on SMPTE
EG 1-1990

↑: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
A: Toggle setup
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bars on gray ==

This pattern shows
color bars on a gray
background. Use it with
color filters to adjust
color balance.
Based on Digital Video
Essentials: HD Basics

↑: Toggle brightness
  (75% or 100%)
A: Toggle setup
  (NTSC or NTSC-J/PAL)
Select: Play 1 kHz tone

== Color bleed ==

Use this pattern to
diagnose color bleed
caused by incorrect
color resampling.
Concept by Konsolkongen

↑↓←→: Move the
  pattern by one pixel
Hold: Move every frame
A: Rotate stripes
Select: Show or hide
  frame counter

== Chroma crosstalk ==

This pattern shows
colored stripes arranged
to show crosstalk
between luma and
chroma of the composite
video output of an
NTSC Super NES.

On composite, "NTSC"
fades in and out.
Through S-Video or RGB,
the stripes are indistinct.
----
The S-ENC or S-RGB chip
encodes the PPU's RGB
output to composite video,
taking shortcuts to save
cost. Because it doesn't
filter chroma before
adding it to luma, diagonal
lines and checkerboard
patterns often produce
crosstalk artifacts.

== SGB sound ==

Super Game Boy can play
48 sound effects and
25 background noises.

↑↓: Choose a setting
←→: Change its value
A: Play sound
Select: Stop sound
